This plugin for [Sketch][] lets you create word clouds and tag clouds inside Sketch.

## Usage
1. Open your Sketch document
2. Click on Plugins -> WordCloud -> WordCloud
3. Enter your words separated by comma
4. Choose the font sizes and probability for vertical text (in percent)
5. Hit ok and the text layers will be added to your project
6. Refine and layout the words to your liking

## Planned Features 
I plan to add the following features:

* improve randomised layout so it looks more like a dense cloud
* add angle variation
* add colour schemes
