# WordCloud Sketch plugin

This plugin for [Sketch][] lets you create word clouds and tag clouds inside Sketch.

## Usage
1. Open your Sketcho document
2. Click on Plugins -> WordCloud -> WordCloud
3. Enter your words separated by comma
4. Choose the font sizes
5. Hit ok and the text layers will be added to your project
6. Refine and layout the words to your liking

## Planned Features & Feedback
I plan to add the following features:

* randomly change between vertical and horizontal text, possibly also adding angle variation
* add color schemes
* randomize layout so it looks more like a cloud

This plugin is heavily inspired by the [Hello World](https://github.com/BohemianCoding/plugins.examples.hello-world) example and by [Radial Lines Sketch plugin](https://github.com/herrhelms/radial-lines-sketch) by [herrhelms](https://github.com/herrhelms).
